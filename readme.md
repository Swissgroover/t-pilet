# How to Generate and Add SSH Key to GitHub

### 1. Create SSH Key
Generate a new SSH key with the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
````

Replace `your_email@example.com` with your GitHub email.

* **Press Enter** to accept the default file location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
* Optionally, set a passphrase for extra security.

### 2. Copy SSH Key to Clipboard

Copy the SSH public key using the following command:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Select and copy the entire output (starting with `ssh-rsa`).

Alternatively, you can use `xclip` to copy it directly:

```bash
xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

If `xclip` is not installed, install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install xclip
```

### 3. Add SSH Key to GitHub

1. Go to GitHub and open **Settings** (click your profile photo in the top-right corner).
2. In the left sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.
3. Click the **New SSH key** button.
4. In the **Title** field, give the key a name (e.g., "Ubuntu Laptop").
5. Paste the copied SSH key in the **Key** field.
6. Click **Add SSH Key**.

### 4. Test the SSH Connection

To ensure the SSH key is set up correctly, run:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see:

```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

Now, you can use SSH to interact with your GitHub repositories!

```

You can now copy this entire block and paste it directly into your `.md` file!
